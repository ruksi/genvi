## Quickstart

```bash
# creates a new directory after asking for a name
curl -fSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruksi/genvi/main/magic/conjure.sh | bash
```

## Requirements

* Linux, macOS or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with a `bash`-like shell
* `python>=3.7` with `pip`
* `git`
* `make`

## What?

`genvi` (<i><b>gen</b>eration of <b>vi</b></i>pers :snake:) is a hyperopinionated
tool for creating Python projects. It's strict, some could even say _too_ strict.
Borderline __evil__.

Each new project is configured with:

:hook: sadistic [`pre-commit hooks`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) to enforce code style
<br/>
:magic_wand: automagical GitHub [`actions`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) to verify pull requests
<br/>
:mage: bewitching testing setup with [`pytest`](pyproject.toml) with coverage reporting
<br/>
:black_cat: occult project management though [`make`](Makefile) for
development

If you want a more concrete example of a `genvi` project, you are looking at one.
`genvi` itself follows the same rules and uses the same tools. Behind the scenes,
the process of creating a new project is renaming files and rewriting a bit of content.
