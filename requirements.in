# these dependencies are also used as distribution requirements (`install_requires`)
# so be extra careful to list __as broad version requirements as possible__ in here
# if planning to distribute the project through PyPI / `pip`
#
# the oldest valid versions are also tested by the CI so make sure you choose carefully
# e.g. use `requests>2` instead of `requests` if you don't want to get `requests==0.2.0`
# from 2011.
